# Modeling-Covid-19-in-Lombardy
<br>
Development of simple compartmental models (SEIR, SIR) in order to simulate the spread of COVID-19 the Lombardy Region. The data used for this project refer to the daily number of new infected individuals during the first wave of the pandemic.

This file has been created in order to propose a solution to a Simulation and Modeling assignment:

**Exercise 1: Calibration**
<br>
Definition of a deterministic compartmental model to capture the spread of Covid-19 and calibration on the the first part of the data that is provided (train days for the provinces: LO: 64, PV: 68, SO:74, MN: 74, MI: 68, CO: 68, BS: 68, MB: 68, LC: 70, CR: 66, BG: 66, VA: 73)


**Exercise 2: Adding age structure to the model**
<br>
Building of a simple SIR model with age structure, where the average number of contacts between individuals of different age classes is defined by the contact matrix defined in the csv italian_matrix.csv.


**Exercise 3: Improve the model**
<br>
Extention of the age-stratified model developed in Exercise 2, adding one or more of the restrictive measures that have been implemented in the Lombardy Region in order reduce the spread of the virus.
